# Employee-Payroll-System

Project Background
Our Payroll Managament System able to generate Salary Slip to the employess while basic salary and bonus are updated by admin. To simulate our project in real life, we have developed an Employee Payroll Management System based on our University UCSI University. This system will be developed using Java Programming, SQL as the Database, and MySQL as the Database Management System.

We have created three Graphical User Inteface (GUI) which are Login GUI, Admin GUI, and Salary Slip GUI. The snapshot of each GUI will be shown in System Design.
